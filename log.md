# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the basic algorithm scripting challenges in Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** So none of them were to difficult, although a few did expose me to some concepts I didn't know about, like the arguments object in javascript. I also was able to help other people in the forums/chat and that felt super cool :).

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 02, Tuesday Year 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the basic algorithm scripting challenges in Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: So none of them were to difficult, although a few did expose me to some concepts I didn't know about, like the arguments object in javascript. I also was able to help other people in the forums/chat and that felt super cool :).

### Day 2: May 03, Tuesday Year 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning R while using tidytext Spent most of the day just trying to figure out how to use Rstudio

**Thoughts**: So it was a nice crash course in R but I found I spent most of the time just figuring out Rstudio. I learned a lot though. I'm trying to be more hands on and less frontloading (reading tutorials and watching a bunch of videos and not actually just trying and breaking stuff XD )

### Day 3: May 04, Tuesday Year 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first three parts of intro to R on Data Camp (Wanted to at least get a feel for the basics)

**Thoughts**: So I decided that although jumping in head first was interesting I should at least know the basics of R so I decided to start the intro to R on datacamp.
